# Simple Weather Info

Deployed to try on [Vercel](https://simple-weather-app-self-one.vercel.app/)

This is a ReactJS front-end that import a list of places with their latitude and longitude from [cities.json](https://github.com/lutangar/cities.json) then use [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to get the current weather info based on the provided lat and long.
